          About Me
        </h2>
        
        <div className="space-y-6 text-dark-100 leading-relaxed">
          <p className="text-lg">
            I've spent my career helping leaders and teams navigate hard problems at the seam between national security, diplomacy, and technology—then translating that complexity into decisions, momentum, and outcomes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I'm currently a Business Operations Lead at Palantir Technologies, where I focus on building and scaling digital operational systems for the U.S. national security enterprise.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Before Palantir, I worked at the highest levels of the U.S. government. In the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, I helped run a fast-moving front office and served as Acting Chief of Staff, coordinating initiatives that demanded speed, precision, and collaboration across the Department and interagency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            At the White House National Security Council, I directed a South Asia portfolio spanning counterterrorism, hostage issues, and diplomacy—where the work often came down to building alignment quickly and executing under uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            At the State Department, I supported senior leadership and worked on the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, strengthening multilateral coordination in the face of evolving threats.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I began closer to the ground: managing a USAID program in Helmand Province, Afghanistan—an experience that shaped how I think about strategy, incentives, and what implementation really requires.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            That throughline—coalition building, disciplined execution, and calm problem-solving under pressure—has shaped how I lead.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I hold dual graduate degrees from Georgetown University (MSFS and MBA) and am a Council on Foreign Relations Term Member. Outside of work, I'm a student of history, technology, the world, and a devoted husband and dad.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I was raised on a dirt road in eastern Washington and played football at Cheney High School.
